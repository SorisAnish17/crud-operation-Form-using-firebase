Project Title: Firebase CRUD Operations with User Authentication

Project Description:
This GitHub project aims to provide a simple web application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Firebase as the backend, along with user authentication. The project consists of three main pages: the Register page, the Login page, and the Profile page.

1. Register Page:
The Register page allows new users to create an account by providing their email address and a password. The page includes a registration form where users can enter their credentials. Upon successful registration, the user's information is securely stored in Firebase's user authentication system, allowing them to access their account in the future.

2. Login Page:
The Login page enables existing users to authenticate themselves and gain access to their account. It features a login form where users can enter their registered email address and password. After successful authentication, users are granted access to the Profile page.

3. Profile Page:
The Profile page serves as the main interface for authenticated users. It displays user-specific information retrieved from Firebase's database. Users can view and modify their profile details, such as their name, contact information, or any other relevant data stored in the database. The page provides options to update or delete their profile information, demonstrating the CRUD operations.

Key Features:
- User Registration: Allow users to create an account with email and password.
- User Login: Authenticate users with their registered credentials.
- Secure Authentication: Utilize Firebase's authentication system for secure user management.
- Profile Information: Retrieve and display user-specific data from the Firebase database.
- Update Profile: Enable users to modify their profile information and save changes to the database.
- Delete Profile: Provide an option for users to delete their account and associated data from the database.

Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.
- Firebase Authentication: Manage user registration and authentication.
- Firebase Realtime Database: Store and retrieve user-specific data.
- GitHub: Version control and collaborative development.

By exploring this GitHub project, developers can gain practical knowledge of implementing CRUD operations using Firebase as the backend and incorporating user authentication into their web applications.
